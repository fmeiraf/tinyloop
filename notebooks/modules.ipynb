      "reasoning='The plot goal is to visualize the correlation between two variables that are both counts of people who have certain diseases. The core requirement is to demonstrate the strength and direction of correlation clearly and precisely. A scatter plot is the most appropriate visual choice for showing correlation between two quantitative variables. To elevate the visualization to publication quality, I will use Matplotlib with consideration for style consistency, color palette, fonts, axes/grid styling, line and marker quality, legend clarity, figure sizing, and export quality. This ensures the plot is not only clear but also aesthetically polished and suitable for academic presentation or publication.' plan='1. Data Preparation: Ensure the dataset contains two numeric vectors representing the counts of people having each disease per observation (e.g., per region, time period, or individual).\\n\\n2. Style & Theme: Apply a consistent, professional style using Matplotlib\\'s built-in styles (for example, \\'seaborn-whitegrid\\' or \\'ggplot\\'), or create a custom rcParams dictionary to unify colors, fonts, and grids.\\n\\n3. Plot Type: Create a scatter plot of the two disease counts, placing one on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis, to visually inspect correlation.\\n\\n4. Color Palette: Use a colorblind-friendly, muted color for the scatter points (e.g., a blue or green from Paul Tol\\'s palette) with partially transparent points (alpha around 0.7) to help deal with overplotting if data points overlap.\\n\\n5. Markers: Use circular markers of moderate size (about 6-8 points) with a subtle edge color (a slightly darker shade or gray) to enhance visibility on white background.\\n\\n6. Axes & Grid: Keep only the left and bottom spines, removing top and right spines to reduce clutter. Use thin, light gray grid lines aligned with major ticks to support value estimation without distraction. Tick marks should face outward and have slight padding from labels.\\n\\n7. Fonts & Text: Use a consistent, readable font family (e.g., a serif font if matching academic text or a clean sans-serif). Set axis labels to about 12 pt, tick labels around 10 pt, and the title around 14-16 pt. Include clear axis labels like \"Number of People with Disease A\" and \"Number of People with Disease B\".\\n\\n8. Statistical Annotation: Compute and include the correlation coefficient (Pearson\\'s r) on the plot as a formatted annotation, positioned unobtrusively in a corner with consistent font style.\\n\\n9. Legend & Annotations: Since only two variables are shown, a legend may not be necessary. If multiple groups or categories exist, a legend should be added with matching marker styles and placed outside or in a non-overlapping corner.\\n\\n10. Figure Layout & Size: Set the figure size appropriately (e.g., around 4x4 or 5x5 inches) to ensure all elements have space and are readable when inserted into a paper or presentation. Use plt.tight_layout() or similar to prevent label cutoff.\\n\\n11. Export & Output: Save the figure as a high-quality vector PDF with embedded fonts for publication or an SVG for web, ensuring text renders crisply and lines are smooth. Additionally, a high-resolution PNG (300+ DPI) can be saved for presentations.\\n\\nImplementing these steps will result in a polished scatter plot showing correlation between the two disease counts, ready for academic or professional use.'\n"

    "\n",
    "    This rubric evaluates key visual aspects of static 2D plots in Matplotlib, with **0 = Not Achieved**, **0.5 = Partially Achieved**, **1 = Achieved**, and an **Extreme Quality** bonus level for maximized excellence in each aspect. The focus is on academic-style, publication-quality visuals.\n",

    "    ## Overall Style & Theme Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 0 (Not Achieved)\n",
    "\n",
    "    No cohesive style; the plot uses default settings or mixes styles inconsistently. Visual elements clash (e.g. one plot uses a dark background, another a light theme) and the overall look is disjointed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 0.5 (Partially Achieved)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Some style customization is present (perhaps a style sheet applied or a few rcParams tweaked), but not all elements are unified. For example, colors or fonts might be updated while grid/axes styling remains default, yielding a semi-polished but still inconsistent appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 1 (Achieved)\n",
    "\n",
    "    A consistent style is applied across the entire plot, either by using a well-designed Matplotlib style sheet or a custom rcParams configuration\n",
    "    All components (fonts, colors, grid, etc.) adhere to a unified theme – nothing looks out of place. For instance, using Matplotlib’s built-in styles (`plt.style.use`) like “ggplot” gives a coordinated look (gray background, larger fonts, and subtle gridlines).\n",
    "    The visual presentation is harmonious and professional.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Extreme Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "    The plot’s theme is maximized for polish and consistency at the highest level. This often means creating a bespoke style sheet for the project or publication, ensuring every detail (down to axis line widths and minor tick styling) is predefined for uniformity\n",
    "    . The style might build on high-quality defaults (e.g. the Seaborn “ticks” style for a clean, minimalist look\n",
    "    ) and then refine it further. At this level, the figure looks publication-ready out-of-the-box – comparable to figures in top journals – with a cohesive aesthetic that enhances readability and looks refined.\n",

    "\n",
    "    ## Color Palette & Contrast\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### 0 (Not Achieved)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Poor color choices undermine the plot. The default or ad-hoc color cycle is used without consideration for clarity or accessibility. This can lead to adjacent elements blending together or harsh contrasts that strain the eyes\n",
    "    . For example, error bars might be the same color as bar fill, making them nearly invisible\n",
    "    , or a bright green line over a blue patch is unpleasant and hard to distinguish\n",
    "    . No thought is given to colorblind-friendly palettes or print (grayscale) legibility.\n",

In truly refined cases, the plot might employ bespoke marker symbols or even subtle gradients/visual effects to enhance visibility (though sparingly, in line with scientific clarity). There is also consideration for print vs. screen: e.g. ensuring that if the figure is printed in black-and-white, the combination of line styles and markers still differentiates the data.
